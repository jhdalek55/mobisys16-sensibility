\section{Practical Challenges and Limitations}\label{sec-limitation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item It's not given that a testbed that runs non-interactive 
experiments is the right answer to ``How can we scale out 
smartphone research'', ``Shall we scale it out at all'', etc.
  \item Researchers could require interactivity, privacy-invasive 
sensor access, and other things that don't map well to S.T.
  \item Are IRBs the right way to solve the problem? E.g., 
rogue researchers that deliberately obfuscate what they will 
do with sensor readings, so as to breach privacy. E.g., 
ignorant IRBs that greenlight everything and put the burden on 
our default IRB (????).
  \item Are blur layers the right way to solve the problem? E.g., 
collect enough data to make use of temporal autocorrelation; secure enough.
  \item Granularity of user interaction is on opt-in / opt-out 
level. No way currently for users to add own blur, cf. Sensorium 
which does have this.
  \item You have to learn the platform first.
\end{itemize}
