Due to their omnipresence, mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablets could be of tremendous value to research. 
Their potential has sparked a number 
of recent research initiatives. 
%such as investigating end-user traffic patterns, etc. 
However, the expanded use of mobile 
devices has resulted in increased privacy and security break-ins 
on these devices. It is therefore challenging for researchers to use 
mobile testbeds as their research platform without compromising
the privacy of device owners. The question remains whether research on 
mobile devices can be carried out using a network testbed, without causing breaches of 
personal privacy and device security. 

In this paper we present Sensibility Testbed, an experiment  
platform that lowers the barriers to performing experiments on 
end users' mobile phones.

%Sensibility Testbed provides privacy protection of mobile device 
%data, and maintains the security of device systems from 
%potentially buggy experiment code. The experiment code in Sensibility 
%Testbed runs in isolated sandboxes to

Access to sensor data on a mobile device is mediated according to the policies 
set by the institutional review board (IRB) of the researcher's 
institution. These policies are enforced by a set of 
\textit{blurring layers} via the secure sandbox. Different policies 
can be customized by loading individual blurring layers in order, 
as a \textit{policy stack}. 
This allows Sensibility Testbed to cater to a wider range of 
participants than prior mobile testbeds. Furthermore, 
Sensibility Testbed's platform design encourages reusing 
experiment infrastructure, and saves researchers' effort in
recruiting participants and managing a deployment. 
Our evaluation shows that \sysname can prevent a wide range
of privacy attacks with low performance overhead.
