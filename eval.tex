\section{Evaluation}

In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of Sensibility Testbed's 
privacy mechanisms, its usability as a mobile testbed, and its 
performance.

\subsection{Deployment experience}


\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

\yanyan{show how effective/efficient it collects data}


\subsection{How does Sensibility Testbed protect privacy?}

\yanyan{show how effective it protects privacy, but still allows
useful experiment}

\subsection{Device owners survey}

\yanyan{show how people feel if their privacy has been 
protected: whether device owners feel the protection is enough.}
