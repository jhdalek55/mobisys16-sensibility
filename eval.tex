\section{Evaluation of Sensibility Testbed}

In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of Sensibility Testbed's 
privacy mechanisms, its usability as a mobile testbed, and its 
performance.

\subsection{Deployment experience}

\yanyan{compare to other projects,  developers can save
thousands of lines of code.}

\yanyan{Sensibility Testbed has been adopted by xxx (mention 
SAS). The experience from the main developer
was overall positive, and identified cases where instructions
for use were unclear. While it took several e-mail exchanges to
clarify these issues, the developer reported that writing the code to
yyy took about an hour or less and
they have used our library since zzz. We are currently in
discussions with other researchers about integrating Sensibility 
Testbed into their research.}

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

\yanyan{show how effective/efficient it collects data}


\subsection{How does Sensibility Testbed protect privacy?}

\yanyan{show how effective it protects privacy, but still allows
useful experiment}

\yanyan{I'm having a hard time coming up with cases to demonstrate this.}

\subsection{Device owners survey}

\yanyan{show how people feel if their privacy has been 
protected: whether device owners feel the protection is enough.}
