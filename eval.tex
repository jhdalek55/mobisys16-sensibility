\section{Evaluation}\label{sec-eval}

In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of Sensibility Testbed's 
privacy mechanisms, its usability as a mobile testbed, and its 
performance.

%\todo{Q: how well the testbed protects privacy, and still allows experiments
%to function? A: \ref{sec-accurate} and \ref{sec-function}.}


\subsection{Sensibility Testbed's Privacy Policies}

\todo{Q1: does ST protect privacy sufficiently? A: 
we need to answer two sub-questions: 

Q1.1: what privacy concerns do people have? A1.1: find in 
the existing literature (past 5 years of MobiSys, MobiCom, 
NSDI, etc.).

Q1.2: does ST address these concerns? A1.2: maybe use 
a table: paper x, sensor(s), our policies.}


\subsection{Privacy Protection and Experiment Functionality}

\todo{Q2: is ST useful for answering research questions? A:
compare the results of an algorithm with varying levels of 
data precision (Seth's algorithm?), and show a diagram suggested
by Justin.}

\yanyan{with the privacy protection in place, is the data we 
provide sufficient for experiments to function?}

%\subsection{Usability}\label{sec-usability}
%
%\yanyan{user survey on privacy: show how people feel if their 
%privacy has been protected, whether device owners feel the 
%protection is enough.}
%
%\yanyan{incentives to participants}

\subsection{Deployment Experience}\label{sec-deployment}

\todo{Q3: how is the testbed being used? A: deployment experience: 
number of people, projects, issues, hackathon.}

%\subsubsection{External Projects and Collaboration}\label{sec-external}

Sensibility Testbed has been adopted by projects such as 
Open3G~\cite{open3g} that investigates on cellular technologies 
and coverage, a vehicle data collection project~\cite{reininger2015first} 
that monitors vehicle traffic patterns. The experience from the 
project developers was positive, and they identified cases where our 
instructions for use were unclear. Despite these clarification issues, in 
the case of Open3G, the developer reported that writing the code to
get cellular information took about an hour and they have used our
testbed since 2012. We are currently in discussions with other 
researchers about integrating Sensibility Testbed into their research
projects, such as monitoring construction safety.

In 2014, we hosted a Hack-a-thon styled, one-day workshop co-located with 
the IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS) \cite{sas}. About twenty 
workshop participants with various backgrounds worked in teams 
for six hours and built four functional applications using Sensibility 
Testbed. None of the participants had any prior experience with 
this testbed, and many of them had no background in Computer
Science. With this success, we hosted a second workshop with 
SAS in 2015, and will continue in 2016. Interesting experiments 
developed by the participants include a device network monitor: 
when the battery level of a device is low, WiFi or Bluetooth that 
requires high power is turned off.

\subsection{Ease of Use}\label{sec-ease}

\todo{Q4: how easy is it to use the testbed? A: ease of use: 
compared to common measurement app (Android), 
how many lines of code can one save (\ref{sec-ease})}

\yanyan{how much time a student spent doing some
measurements (like Thomas's motion detection alg).}

\yanyan{compare to other projects,  developers can save
thousands of lines of code, and reuse the same set of 
devices.}

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}\label{sec-benchmark}

\todo{Q5: what's the overhead? A: CPU/memory overhead 
and battery (\ref{sec-benchmark}).}

\yanyan{briefly show how effective/efficient it collects data, 
and overhead compared to native.}
