\section{Evaluation of Sensibility Testbed}

In this section we evaluate the effectiveness of Sensibility Testbed's 
privacy mechanisms, its usability as a mobile testbed, and its 
performance.

\todo{Q: how is the testbed being used? A: deployment experience: 
number of people, projects, issues, etc. (\ref{sec-external})}

\todo{Q: how easy is it to use the testbed? A: ease of use: 
hackathon; compared to common measurement app (Android), 
how many lines of code can one save (\ref{sec-ease})}

\todo{Q: what's the overhead? A: overhead and battery (\ref{sec-benchmark})}

\todo{Q: how well the testbed protects privacy, and still allows experiments
to function? A: \ref{sec-accurate} and \ref{sec-function}.}

\todo{Q: how people feel if their privacy has been protected? are they willing
to participate? A: \ref{sec-usability}}

\subsection{Deployment experience}\label{sec-deployment}


\subsubsection{External Projects}\label{sec-external}

\yanyan{Sensibility Testbed has been adopted by xxx. 
The experience from the main developer
was overall positive, and identified cases where instructions
for use were unclear. While it took several e-mail exchanges to
clarify these issues, the developer reported that writing the code to
yyy took about an hour or less and
they have used our library since zzz. We are currently in
discussions with other researchers about integrating Sensibility 
Testbed into their research.}

\subsubsection{Ease of Use}\label{sec-ease}

\yanyan{SAS hackathon apps, used by people outside of CS}

\yanyan{how much time a student spent doing some
measurements (like Thomas's motion detection alg).}

\yanyan{compare to other projects,  developers can save
thousands of lines of code.}

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}\label{sec-benchmark}

\yanyan{briefly show how effective/efficient it collects data, 
and overhead compared to native.}

\subsubsection{Measurement Overhead}

\subsubsection{Battery Consumption}


\subsection{Privacy Protection}


\subsubsection{Data Accuracy}\label{sec-accurate}

\yanyan{compare the results of an algorithm on blurred data 
collected from the testbed vs more frequent collection. this is 
useful for showing that we collect a representative sample of 
the data (Seth's algorithm?)}

\subsubsection{Experiment Functionality}\label{sec-function}

\yanyan{with the privacy protection in place, is the data we 
provide sufficient for experiments to function?}

\todo{need to find a good use case.}


\subsection{Usability}\label{sec-usability}

\yanyan{user survey on privacy: show how people feel if their 
privacy has been protected, whether device owners feel the 
protection is enough.}

\yanyan{incentives to participants}
