\section{Introduction}

Today's end-user mobile devices, such as smartphones and
tablets, have become indispensable gadgets in people's everyday
life, and thus have created increasing research opportunities.
As a result, the Internet architecture, end-user traffic
patterns, etc., have also evolved rapidly. These devices
generate useful information for service providers and policy
makers to enhance network research and the services provided.
These devices also provide a platform for researchers to
investigate how new applications can provide better performance.
As a result, there has been significant interests in the network
community to study mobile network and devices, and in the
systems community to deploy new services and test research
prototypes, such as Phonelab~\cite{phonelab, nandugudi2013phonelab}, 
Mobilyzer~\cite{nikravesh2015mobilyzer}, etc.
					
For researchers, however, there are two obstacles for research
about mobile devices. First, the privacy and security challenges
have increased dramatically over the years. The use of 
smartphones and tablets has introduced a new class of threats. 
For example, a smartphone's GPS locations,
WiFi connections, or Bluetooth pairing history can be highly
personal; a malicious party could also potentially bypass a
device's security protections and gain access to user
privileges. In particular, some seemingly benign apps can be a 
source of companies or governments to access ordinary 
people's daily activities~\cite{AngryBirds}. 
We not only need to ensure the security of a device
so that researcher's code cannot inadvertently damage or
maliciously hack into the device, but also protect the privacy
of device owners so that the code cannot eavesdrop on phone
conversations or infer passwords.

Second, it is challenging for researchers to perform meaningful
research related to end users without compromising data privacy
and ethical merit. Currently, research institutions adopt an
institutional review board (IRB) approval process where a
formally designated committee reviews, approves, and monitors
research involving human subjects~\cite{irb}.
Due to the different goals and unforeseen risks of each
individual project, the researcher needs to recruit subjects for
each research study, obtain their informed consent, etc. This
process is time-consuming, and the researcher needs to repeat
the process for different projects. Even with the
recruited participants, the researchers from different research
groups cannot test their hypothesis at a world-wide scale or
reuse each other's user base.

Currently, there are two ways to conduct mobile experiments. 
First, many mobile research projects conduct experiments 
by either distributing an app through a marketplace, or using a 
small number of lab devices~\cite{hao2013isleep, wang2012no, 
wang2013sensing}. This usage model does not require any 
platform support (with the exception of a marketplace), but it 
is difficult for external research groups to reuse the experiment 
code, the participating devices, or reproduce the experiment 
setup. Second, research projects can be carried out on 
smartphone testbeds, such as Phonelab~\cite{phonelab, 
nandugudi2013phonelab} and 
Mobilyzer~\cite{nikravesh2015mobilyzer}. 
The problem with these testbeds is that they do not yet 
have a systematic way to protect device owners' security and 
privacy. To lower potential risks, many of them choose to 
recruit participants from a trusted group, such as students and 
colleagues. For example, PhoneLab provides a platform for 
people to run Android apps on their participants' smartphones 
and log data from these devices. Each participant is provided 
with an Android device and data plan at a very low cost. This 
approach cannot solve the privacy issue. Although PhoneLab 
requires experimenters to submit an IRB approval letter for 
human subjects compliance, the experimenters have to enforce
the IRB policies in their experiments~\cite{nandugudi2013phonelab}. 
Moreover, with the above usage models, researchers from 
different research groups are not able to test their hypothesis 
at a world-wide scale or reuse each others' user base.
					
This work is a first step towards lowering the technical
barriers to mobile Internet research without lowering the
ethical standard~\cite{zevenbergen2013ethical}, while 
protecting the security and privacy of end users. Our testbed 
infrastructure codifies experimenters' IRB policies and 
implements these policies on end devices. Our work also 
maximizes the reuse of experiment infrastructure, thus reducing 
experimenters' recruitment and deployment burden. 

We design and implement Sensibility Testbed~\cite{sensibility, 
zhuang2014sensibility}, an Internet-wide testbed for mobile devices that
allows researchers to run code and deploy services on ordinary
people's smartphones or tablets for research purpose. It ensures
the security of user-owned devices and the privacy of
user-generated data. First, the usage model of Sensibility Testbed is
unique in that it maintains testbed services to manage how device 
owners make their devices accessible to different research 
communities anonymously, without putting
their devices at risk. Meanwhile, it offers technical measures
that allow researchers to collect data from remote mobile
devices without impairing the device owner's privacy, by codifying 
experimenters' IRB policies on end devices. The
Sensibility Testbed also relieves researcher from the burden of
recruiting subjects for every single experiment, and 
experimenters can share their code and user base by reusing
our testbed infrastructure; the device
owners need only give consents once, instead of giving multiple
consents to each project of each researcher.\yanyan{device owners
can opt out an experiment: not implemented yet but shall we 
mention this?}

Sensibility Testbed makes experiment
prototyping faster, the remote control and management of devices
easier, and running experiment code more secure. The
contributions of this work are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We design Sensibility Testbed, which uses security and 
privacy techniques to minimize the technical challenges for 
network researchers to perform meaningful research, without 
compromising ethical merit.

\item Sensibility Testbed supports generation of data access 
policies, specified by a researcher, and implementation of 
these policies on mobile devices to protect the privacy of 
device owners.

\item Sensibility Testbed reduces experimenters' burden of 
recruiting subjects; experimenters can share their code and 
user base by reusing our testbed infrastructure.

%A consortium structure for minimizing the pain of IRB 
%approvals.  This enables participants to opt in to a large 
%array of very low risk experiments and for experimenters to 
%get a blanket approval to work with that pool of participants.  
%This eliminates the need for every experiment to get approval 
%from every participant.\yanyan{not sure about this.}

\item We implement Sensibility Testbed, evaluate its effectiveness
in protecting device owners' privacy, and its performance 
\yanyan{what performance can we show?}
\end{enumerate}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec-design}
we introduce the design of Sensibility Testbed.
